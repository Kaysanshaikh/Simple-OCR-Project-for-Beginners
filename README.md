Project Description: OCR with Tesseract and Python
Overview
This project involves creating a web service that uses Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to process images and extract textual information and bounding boxes around text. The service is built with Python and provides two main functionalities:

Extracting the text content from images.
Extracting bounding box information for each text segment in the images.
Objectives
OCR Processing: Utilize Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
Bounding Box Extraction: Determine the coordinates of bounding boxes around recognized text.
